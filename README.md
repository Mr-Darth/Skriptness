# Skriptness
> A vast collection of Skript resources, varying from short snippets to fully fledged systems and tutorials.

## NOTE: I am currently going through all my stuff and cleaning everything up. You will see more and more resources appear here *soon*:tm:.

Skriptness is a collection of various Skript-related resources that I've accumulated throughout the years, centralised into one single, big repository available to everyone.

I've tried my best to nicely organise everything by its purpose/topic and provide detailed descriptions and explanations of all content.
