# Skriptness/scripts
This is where all scripts/snippets/anything that's (reusable) Skript code goes.

Everything is thoroughly documented. Implementation notes are provided along with explanatory comments throughout code.

### Requirements
All files contain the requirements and versions the code was tested on. Most scripts rely either on pure Skript only, or on Skript & skript-reflect and have been tested on [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper).
