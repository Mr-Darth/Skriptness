# Skriptness/scripts
This is where all scripts/snippets/anything that's (reusable) Skript code goes.

Everything is thoroughly documented. Implementation notes are provided along with explanatory comments throughout code.

Most scripts rely either on pure Skript only, or on Skript & skript-reflect. All files contain the requirements and versions the code was tested on.
